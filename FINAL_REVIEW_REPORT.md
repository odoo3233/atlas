# Final Review Report

This report summarizes the comprehensive review of the Atlas Al-Sharq project, detailing the issues found, fixes implemented, and the final state of the application.

## 1. Build and Code Health

- **Merge Conflicts:** All merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) have been removed from the codebase, including stale markers found in the `backend/` directory and `package-lock.json` files.
- **Build Errors:** The project now builds successfully without any errors. The following issues were resolved:
    - Fixed a null-pointer error on `searchParams` in `/login` by wrapping the component in a `<Suspense>` boundary.
    - Corrected missing `useState` import in `/login`.
    - Defined and exported `ApiError` and `NetworkError` classes in `lib/api.ts` to resolve missing module errors.
    - Corrected a typo (`statusCode` to `status`) in `lib/error-handler.ts`.
- **Metadata Warnings:** All Next.js metadata warnings were resolved by moving the `viewport` and `themeColor` definitions to a `generateViewport` export in the root `layout.tsx`.

## 2. Internationalization (i18n) and Localization

- **Namespace Consistency:** The project uses a single, global namespace for translations, which is consistently applied. All components now correctly use the `useTranslation` hook.
- **Translation Completeness:** The translation files (`ar.json`, `en.json`, `zh.json`) have a consistent structure. There are no missing keys, ensuring a complete experience in all three languages.
- **RTL/LTR Functionality:**
    - Language direction is now handled dynamically. An `I18nProvider` was created to listen for language changes and automatically set the `lang` and `dir` attributes on the `<html>` element.
    - The hardcoded `lang="ar"` and `dir="rtl"` attributes were removed from the root layout.
    - RTL-specific styles in Tailwind CSS (`rtl:*`) are correctly applied.

## 3. Local Runtime Verification

The project runs locally without any console errors.
- **Frontend:** `npm run dev` starts the Next.js server, typically on `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`.
- **Backend:** `node src/index.js` starts the API server on `http://localhost:5001`.

## Conclusion

The project is now in a stable, error-free state. The codebase is clean, the build process is successful, and the internationalization and RTL functionalities are robust and consistent. The application is ready for further development or deployment.
