# Final Report: Stability, Design, and i18n Fixes

This report outlines the steps taken to resolve the critical runtime errors, stabilize the project, and ensure the design remains consistent across all supported languages.

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue was a corrupted project state, likely due to file locks from running development servers and improper cache cleaning. This led to critical Next.js errors (`missing required error components`, `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clientModules')`) that made the application unusable.

## 2. Recovery and Stabilization

A full project reset was performed to ensure a clean state:

-   **Clean Workspace:** The `.next` cache, `node_modules`, and `package-lock.json` were successfully removed using the correct PowerShell commands.
-   **Fresh Installation:** All dependencies were reinstalled using `npm install`.
-   **Successful Build:** A full production build (`npm run build`) now completes without any errors, confirming the codebase is stable.
-   **Metadata Warnings:** All SEO-related `metadataBase` warnings were resolved by setting a production URL in the root layout.

## 3. i18n and Design Consistency

The user reported that the design would "break" or be "deleted" when language features were modified. This was addressed by implementing a robust i18n handling system:

-   **Dynamic Direction Control:** A client-side `I18nProvider` was implemented. This provider listens for language changes and automatically updates the `<html>` tag's `lang` and `dir` attributes. This is the correct approach for handling RTL (Arabic) and LTR (English, Chinese) switching in a Next.js App Router application.
-   **Layout Decoupling:** The root layout (`layout.tsx`) was modified to remove the hardcoded `dir="rtl"`, allowing the new provider to manage the document direction dynamically.
-   **Consistent Design:** With the new provider, the design and styling now remain perfectly intact when switching between languages. All pages were tested to confirm that components render correctly and Tailwind's RTL styles (`rtl:*`) are applied as expected.

## 4. Final Verification

-   The local development server now runs without crashing.
-   Navigating between pages works as expected.
-   Language switching is seamless and does not cause any UI or console errors.

## Conclusion

The project is now stable, functional, and visually consistent across all languages. The underlying issues that caused the design to break have been resolved by cleaning the project state and implementing a proper i18n provider. The application is now ready for further development and deployment.
